        <h2 class="bluefont leftfont">What is the main characteristic of XQuery?</h2><br>
        <p class="leftfont">XQuery is a language for querying and transforming XML data. It is similar to SQL, which is a language for querying relational databases.</p>
        
        <p class="leftfont">XQuery can be used to:</p>
        <p class="leftfont">
        &emsp;&#10148; Find specific elements or attributes in an XML document.<br>
        &emsp;&#10148; Extract data from an XML document and transform it into another<br>&emsp;&emsp; format, such as HTML, JSON, or CSV.<br>
        &emsp;&#10148; Generate dynamic XML content.<br>
        &emsp;&#10148; Perform complex queries on XML data, such as joining multiple XML<br>&emsp;&emsp; documents or filtering data based on complex criteria.<br>
        </p>
        <p class="leftfont">
        XQuery is a powerful language that can be used for a variety of tasks related to XML data processing. It is especially useful for developing web applications that need to interact with XML data.
        </p>

            <h3 class="greenfont leftfont">Pros</h3>
            <p class="leftfont">
            <strong>Expressiveness</strong>: XQuery is a very expressive language, so it is easy to write complex queries and transformations. It supports various operators, functions, and constructs.<br><br>

            <strong>Efficiency</strong>: XQuery is implemented using native browser technologies, so it is efficient. XQIB engines are optimized to execute XQuery code quickly.<br><br>
                               
            <strong>Declarative</strong>: XQuery is a declarative language, so it makes XQuery code more readable and maintainable than procedural languages.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h3 class="greenfont leftfont">Cons</h3>
            <p class="leftfont">
            <strong>Learning curve</strong>: XQuery has a steeper learning curve than SQL. The developers could not learn and use XQuery effectively.<br><br>

            <strong>Limited adoption</strong>: XQuery has not been as widely adopted as SQL.  It is difficult to find developers with XQuery experience.<br><br>

            <strong>Lack of standardization</strong>: XQuery has multiple implementations, so it leads to compatibility issues between different XQIB engines.<br><br>

            <strong>Limited community</strong>: The XQuery community is relatively small. It is more difficult to find resources and support for XQuery development.

            <h2 class="bluefont leftfont">What is the XQuery of hw8.xq doing if applied on the XML of hw8.xml?</h2><br>
            <p class="leftfont">
            The <a href="hw8.xml" target="_blank">hw8.xml</a> file is a comprehensive index of books. It includes book titles, authors, prices, and classification. The <a href="hw8.xq" target="_blank">hw8.xq</a> file contains an XQuery script. The data source is from <a href="hw8.xml" target="_blank">hw8.xml</a>. When two files work together, the script lists the book's title price as less than $30.
            </p>

            <h3>When we change the hw8.xq file to follow as</h3>

            <h3>We could get the result on "<a href="https://www.videlibri.de/cgi-bin/xidelcgi" target="_blank">XPath 3.1 / XQuery 3.1 / CSS 3 Selector / JSONiq Online Tester</a>" website</h3>

            <h3>It can output HTML format directly, so we could use it on our HTML.</h3>

        <h2 class="bluefont leftfont">Do a brief research and explain what is XQIB and how it can be used with XQuery?</h2><br>
        <p class="leftfont">
        &#10148; XQIB(XQuery In the Browser) is a way to use the XQuery language to<br>&emsp; query and transform XML data in a web browser. It is a standard that is<br>&emsp; supported by most modern browsers, and it does not require any plugins<br>&emsp; to be installed.
        </p>
        <p class="leftfont">
        &#10148; To use XQIB, you simply need to write your XQuery code in a script tag<br>&emsp; with the type <strong>application/xquery</strong>. The XQIB engine will then execute the<br>&emsp; code and output the results to the web page.
