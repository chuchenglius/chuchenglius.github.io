          1. You will insert in this new XML file (hw4.xml), for each Client, a new element that you will call <em><strong>&lt;Years&gt;<span style="color: #ff0000;">x</span>&lt;/Years&gt;</strong></em> where x will be a number between 1 and 10 that would show how many years that person is a client for ABC Financial Startup company. Please, make this x be greater than 7 at least for one or a couple of clients!<br>
          2. You will create the following as required in the new XSL file (hw4.xsl).<br>
          2-1. The first line is a simple h1 element<br>
          2-2. Add the name of the image is financialstartup.jpg and the image is centralized within the width of the browser.<br>
          2-3. The paragraph below the image is a simple paragraph.<br>
          2-4. The second paragraph uses what was learned in XPath to count the number of clients the company currently has<br>
          2-5. The third paragraph uses also what has been learned to list the names of the clients separated by , (comma), but the last name will come preceded by , and (comma and word and).<br>
          2-6. The last paragraph also uses what has been learned in XPath to count the clients that have been with the company for more than 7 years!<br>
