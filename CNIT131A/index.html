        <td>"XSLT" is the second homework in this course. It has some targets follow as:<br>
          1. You will present a h1 that says: List of Clients<br>
          2. You will present the clients in a table presenting the name, phone, email, account_total<br>
          3. The account_total value should be right-aligned within the column<br>
          4. When the account_total is less or equal to 80000, the number should be presented in red color and bold.<br>
          5. There should be a $ (dollar sign) in front of the account_total value when presented on the table

        <td>"XPath, XSL-FO" is this week's topic. It has some targets follow as:<br>
          1. You will insert in this new XML file (hw4.xml), for each Client, a new element that you will call <em><strong>&lt;Years&gt;<span style="color: #ff0000;">x</span>&lt;/Years&gt;</strong></em> where x will be a number between 1 and 10 that would show how many years that person is a client for ABC Financial Startup company. Please, make this x be greater than 7 at least for one or a couple of clients!<br>
          2. You will create the following as required in the new XSL file (hw4.xsl).<br>
          2-1. The first line is a simple h1 element<br>
          2-2. Add the name of the image is financialstartup.jpg and the image is centralized within the width of the browser.<br>
          2-3. The paragraph below the image is a simple paragraph.<br>
          2-4. The second paragraph uses what was learned in XPath to count the number of clients the company currently has<br>
          2-5. The third paragraph uses also what has been learned to list the names of the clients separated by , (comma), but the last name will come preceded by , and (comma and word and).<br>
          2-6. The last paragraph also uses what has been learned in XPath to count the clients that have been with the company for more than 7 years!<br>

        <td>"DTD" is this week's topic. It has some targets follow as:<br>
          1. You will use the <strong>hw5.xml</strong> to complete this assignment.<br>
          2. You will create a DTD file (external file, called <strong>hw5.dtd</strong>) or an internal DTD (inside the <strong>hw5.xml</strong>) based on the following assumptions that I'm sure you will be able to detect by reading the hw5.xml code.<br>
          2-1. The <strong>ProdID</strong> attribute is required and is unique (cannot be repeated to any other product inserted in the XML file)<br>
          2-2. The <strong>Color</strong> element is optional<br>
          2-3. Notice that "<strong>Made in USA</strong>" shows up in every product, which means it can be declared as an <strong>Entity</strong> in the DTD<br>
          2-4. For the XML file to be considered valid, you need to have at least one product listed<br>
          3. Based on the rules you will specify in the DTD, I will be able to create a new product in the XML file and the new product will be accepted as valid or invalid based on the rules of the DTD

        <td>"Schema" is this week's topic. It has some targets follow as:<br>
          1. For this homework, you will use the <strong>hw6.xml</strong>(you can find this file inside the <strong>CNIT131AFiles.zip</strong> folder you have downloaded).<br>
          2. You will create the Schema (<strong>hw6.xsd</strong>) file based on the following assumptions:<br>
          2-1. The <strong>Name</strong> should only accept a maximum of 30 characters<br>
          2-2. The <strong>Age</strong> should have a minimum value of 21 and if nothing is stated for age, the default value should be 21<br>
          2-3. The <strong>Date</strong> should be in that format that you see in hw6.xml file<br>
          2-4. The <strong>Phone</strong> should always be using that pattern of 3 digits - 3 digits - 4 digits<br>
          3. You need to make sure that you will be able to validate the XML file against the XSD - see the reference to some free online validators given below<br>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><a href="hw7final.xml" target="_blank">Homework7</a></td>
        <td>"Namespace" is this week's topic. It has some targets follow as:<br>
          1. You will put <strong>hw7.xml</strong> and <strong>hw7a.xml</strong> together in a file named <strong>hw7final.xml</strong> and, one of the namespaces should be declared as the default and the other one with a prefix of your choice.<br>
          2. Then, put all the elements from both files in the same file and use the prefix accordingly to differentiate states from the <strong>east</strong> and <strong>west</strong> part of the country.<br>
          3. You will create a CSS file that you will name <strong>hw7.css</strong>, to present the final result of this assignment and the CSS should format the data with the following styles:<br>
          3-1. Each state should be presented in a different line<br>
          3-2. The states from west should be presented with a different background color (not the same background color of the state from the east)<br>
          <strong>TIP:</strong> As you will need to use namespace in the CSS file as well, you should use the <strong>@namespace prefix URL</strong> in the first line of your CSS file to declare the namespace you will be using in your CSS selector. Then, whenever you want to use the prefix for a certain element of the XML, you should use it following this format <strong>prefix|element</strong><br>
