Next time you do using Google Drive (Docs, or Spreadsheet, or Slides, you need to make sure that you share based on having the hyperlink only - I ended up in a screen that I would have to request access to you to see the slides! Make sure you share with "Anyone wit the link can read it"! The presentation was interesting but most of the presentation was not based on the Graphic presented (-0.5) When you talked about users vs new users, good explanation but you never mentioned that when you subtract those numbers you would get 13,000 which would be returning "old" users and what exactly those numbers could mean if they keep growing or decreasing? How would you interpret average engagement time going up or down? How would you link it to content, and/or ease of navigation (to find content)? If I have a higher number of users coming from direct channel, could it mean that the branding/marketing, and/or choice of domain name were good enough to make the user know the URL of the site? What about organic search being the second number? Could it mean that something related to SEO technique was well done but with space for improvement?
