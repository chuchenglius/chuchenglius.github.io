Nice work but not sure why using <div> tags and then including ARIA role attributes instead of using the semantic tag that exactly describes what you need to describe to the content!?! (-0.3) The use of the nested Person schema was done in a great way but some Food for thought - from that person schema, you could have a span for the first name of the director with itemprop="givenName" and another span for the last name with the itemprop="familyName", right? Advice: avoid using name of file with extension in the value of alt attribute as that . (dot) is read by screen reader as "dot" and it makes really confusing the understanding of the image - it's the description of the image and not the name of the file!
