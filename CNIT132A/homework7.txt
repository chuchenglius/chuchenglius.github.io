Nice work and details: Part 1 - the animation looked great up to the point that the banner was set to the middle as you kept the rotation of the banner indefinitely when it was supposed to stop and stay in the middle put (-0.5) The extra credit was not considered as having a button with JavaScript was not the request as you should have used the @prefers-reduced-motion media query as mentioned in the animation lesson - this will test the feature/setting of the browser in case a user turns that feature on because he/she does not want to see any motion in any web page! The button to stop or continue animation is another feature that is good to have when you have an infinite movement that might annoy the user - this was explained in the lecture - this is an advanced HTML and CSS course that does not include JavaScript, hope you understand the difference! Great work in Part 2 with the shape-outside and with the use of @container especially that you used a relative unit for font-size of h2 (smaller) - if you want, you can share part 2 in the forum so others can see your work
