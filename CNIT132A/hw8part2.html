				<h2>Report Analysis</h2>
				This report is from 1st, January to 16th, May. We posted the website information on Facebook on
				15th, May. We read the report to know the changes.<br>
				<br>
				There were 30 new users during this period, but the total number of viewers was 112 because of the
				repeat viewers.<br>
				The end-users are coming from the link directly more than the search.<br>
				Their locations come from the USA, Taiwan, Europe, and Vietnam. The top hit page is
				"Assignments".<br>
				<br>
				If we want to optimize SEO data to attract more users to the webpage, we have some ways of improving
				it.<br>
				<ul>
					<li>1. We could optimize the most popular pages and improve keyword optimization and content to
						attract
						more users.</li>
					<li>2. We could use the "<a href="https://keywordtool.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Keyword Tool</a>" website categorization, and we give different SEO data based
						on
						each platform.</li>
					<li>3. We could add local keyword language for each country because that will be close to their
						culture.</li>
					<li>4. We also can set up the sitemap because that could help the web crawler to know your website.
					</li>
				</ul>
				When we implement these suggestions, we can enhance website visibility and attract a wider audience.
