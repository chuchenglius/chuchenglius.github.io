Kevin, nice work but details: The heading of home page, or meta description tag, or hyperlinks, or alt attributes, or title tags should not contain words well-known only to a restricted group/community - for ex.: CNIT 132A is only known within CCSF community - so you should prefer using Advanced HTML and CSS as it's the name of the course and contains more searchable and well-known keywords instead of CNIT 132A. The meta description of your HOMEPAGE was <meta name="description" content="San Francisco, Taiwan, CCSF, CNIT"> - this is not describing your page, it's a bunch of separated keywords - this would be ok for meta keywords tag - your meta description should be something as <meta name="description" content="Kevin's portfolio showcasing advanced html and css, SEO, accessibility, google analytics at CCSF San Francisco"> . The same is valid to the other main pages (assignments, contact) you are DESCRIBING in a summarized way, the content of your page! This observation is also valid to the meta og tags for social media as this is what shows in Google search engine response page right below the link to the page - you want a short description that attract users to your page(s) and valid to all the pages of your assignments - for example, in the accessibility microdata assignment, "great movies" should not be an important keyword because you are only using a read web page to demonstrate your skills using microdata, and other tools/features to enhance accessibility! (-1) The name of your image, as well as the alt attribute should be changed according to the SEO keywords you researched - you wrote: <img class="mypic" src="mypicture.JPG" alt="My picture"> - mypicture is a VERY generic name - it could be Kevin_picture.JPG and the alt could be "headshot of Kevin with glasses". The picture of Taiwan is good and it has a relatively good alt attribute but the question is: do you want call people to your site because of your skills or because you are from Taiwan?! So, enhance the alt attribue and name of the file for YOUR OWN PICTURE! (-0.2) The SEO keywords page has a good explanation but, again, you need to understand that those keywords should not be used in the meta description tag loose - they need to be part of the context of your content! If you would include <meta name="keywords"...> tag then, that would be ok to have those keywords loose separated by comma but, as explained in the lecture, the meta keywords is not highly considered by Google new algorithm! (-0.3) Google Analytics Report - the page looks good but the use of embed or iframe to present pdf documents is not recommended as it's not very safe! The link to download the pdf document should not be only the image of the Adobe PDF logo, it should be the whole sentence especially that the alt attribute of that image is not describing the report that the user will be downloading. (-0.2) The analysis of the report is good because of the conclusion but there were more to be observed that you did not - you mentioned what the user could see: the assignments page was the most viewed page - but why? Does it mean that when you sent your site, you sent the URL of the Assignments page and not the Homework? Having some explanation to what happened in the "marketing" of the site as well as the content of the site will then give you a better perspective of what to do to enhance the visibility and engagement of visitors! (-0.5) Advice: avoid centralize content on the page - it's not the natural way of reading and you end up causing eye strain!
