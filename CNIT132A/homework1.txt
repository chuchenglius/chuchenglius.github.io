Nice work and still using a lot of div tags instead of the more semantic tags! Think about those and get used to those - for example, why <div class="main"> instead of using the <main> tag directly? Also, if you are using external CSS, avoid the use of style attribute in your HTML as it will just make it harder to maintain! I saw the GA4 in all pages Contact page - why including a form if the form is not working? You could have just put your email, a link to your LinkedIn profile (if you have one) and a link to your GitHub account as you have one and that would be enough for customers, recruiters, etc. to contact you - better than a form that is not working.
